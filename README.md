This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Zomato‚Äôs sales and user behavior in 2020 using data analysis techniques, including **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) and **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) in **Tableau**. The project provides insights into user loss, city performance, and key demographics.

## üìä Project Overview

### Key Findings:
- **User Loss**: 33,000 users were lost during 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**

#### a. **Extract**:
- I started by collecting sales and user data from various sources, containing key fields such as `user_id`, `user_name`, `order_date`, and `city`.

#### b. **Transform**:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing data, and ensured consistent formatting of dates and fields.
- **Data Structuring**: Structured the data for better readability and performance in Tableau, including adding calculated fields like `first_order_date`, `last_order_date`, and `age_group`.

#### c. **Load**:
- Loaded the cleaned and structured data into **Tableau** for further analysis and visualization.

### 2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

#### a. **User Dynamics**:
- Calculated the number of users lost and gained over the year.
- Visualized the 33,000-user loss in 2020, highlighting the probable impact of COVID-19 lockdowns.

#### b. **City-Level Analysis**:
- **Bangalore**: Showed the highest sales quantity and total sales amount but also the highest user loss (592 users).
- **Delhi**: Emerged as the city with the most user gains.

#### c. **Demographics**:
- Identified the age group **22-25** as the most active in ordering food online, which provided valuable insights into target demographics for recovery and growth strategies.
